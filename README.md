# Payment Gateway - Payment Integration

## Introduction

Payment Gateway  is a Flutter application designed to demonstrate seamless integration with multiple payment gateways. This app serves as a reference for developers looking to implement similar payment functionalities in their Flutter projects. The primary focus is on the backend integration, providing a straightforward, secure, and efficient method for processing payments.

## Features

- Integration with [List of Payment Gateways, e.g., Stripe, PayPal, Paymob].
- Sample transactions for payment processing.
- Backend setup instructions for handling payments.
- Security best practices for payment processing.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Flutter (Version 3.13.9)
- Dart (Version 3.1.5)
- A basic understanding of Flutter and Dart.
- Accounts on the payment gateways you wish to integrate.

### Installation

1. Clone the repo:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/mahmoudashry98/Payment-Gateway.git

### Configuration

Payment Gateway Setup
For each payment gateway, you'll need to perform specific setup steps. Here's a general outline you can adapt:

### Stripe

Sign up for an account at https://docs.stripe.com/.
Obtain your API keys and add them to the app's configuration file: lib/config/payment_config.dart (Note: This is a placeholder path, adjust according to your project structure).
Follow the gateway-specific documentation here:  https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object.
(Repeat this section for each payment gateway integrated into your app.)

### Usage

This section provides a brief overview of how to use the integrated payment functionalities within the app. Include any necessary steps for initiating a payment, selecting a payment method, etc.

Security Considerations
Discuss any security measures you've implemented or recommend (e.g., using environment variables for API keys, validating transactions on the backend).
